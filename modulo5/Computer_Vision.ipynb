        "In this section we will talk about using a pretrained CNN as apart of our own custom network to improve the accuracy of our model. We know that CNN's alone (with no dense layers) don't do anything other than map the presence of features from our input. This means we can use a pretrained CNN, one trained on millions of images, as the start of our model. This will allow us to have a very good convolutional base before adding our own dense layered classifier at the end. In fact, by using this techique we can train a very good classifier for a realtively small dataset (< 10,000 images). This is because the convnet already has a very good idea of what features to look for in an image and can find them very effectively. So, if we can determine the presence of features all the rest of the model needs to do is determine which combination of features makes a specific image.\n",

This involves not touching or retraining the earlier layers in our convolutional base but only adjusting the final few. We do this because the first layers in our base are very good at extracting low level features lile lines and edges, things that are similar for any kind of image. Where the later layers are better at picking up very specific features like shapes or even eyes. If we adjust the final layers than we can look for only features relevant to our very specific problem.\n",
